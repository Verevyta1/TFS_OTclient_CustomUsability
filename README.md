# TFS_OTClient_CustomSpells
 

When I started this task, I had no knowledge of how to set up a server and a client like this. It took me a good amount of time, and due to some technical issues, I had to take the decision to use the 1.4.2 version of OTS which worked. The first spell I worked on was Ethernal_Winter where I modified the code of the existing spell to match the requirements. For the jump game, I created my own files in the client and then used existing code in the server folders to be able to call the function file in the client. I found it quite complicated at first to figure out how to move the button as I was trying to modify other game components instead of making my own.


Regarding the use of the 1.4.2 version instead of the 1.4 version, I feel like I gained enough experience to confidently try using the 1.4 in the future by fixing the previous compilation errors.

I added comments in each file about the things I changed and why.
All the files I modified are in the Q5 and Q7 folders; you can find them among the server and client files too.

For Q5 I didn't replicate the exact pattern from the video as it was quite hard due to a bug that made the grid not match with what was drawn on the screen. But I tried to replicate the essence of the spell which is having multiple casts in one spell.

The spell can be cast by typing frigo and the button game can be played by typing jump.

I did not attempt Q6 as the learning curve for the previous things was too big and it consumed most of the allocated time plus an extension. If I were to try it I estimate it would take me around a week to figure it out.


Overall, although I know I don't have high chances, I tried my best to my abilities and I'm happy to have gained some new skills along the way.

Thank you for your consideration.
